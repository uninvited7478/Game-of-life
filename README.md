# Game-of-life
The game of life is an example of a cellular automaton. It was invented by John Horton Conway, a British mathematician, in 1970. It takes place on a square grid of cells, where each cell can be either alive or dead. Their behavior is governed by the following rules:

A cell comes to life when it has exactly three neighbors alive.
A cell survives when it has two or three living neighbors (it dies when it has fewer than two - from loneliness, or when it has more than four - from overcrowding).
